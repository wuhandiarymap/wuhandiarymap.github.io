						Between January 25 and March 24 in 2020, Fang Fang (方方) wrote daily diary entries about the situation in Wuhan and published them online. This project is an effort to visualize the locations she mentioned each day.
					</p>
					<p>
						The map on the left shows Wuhan and its districts. If a district is green, it was mentioned in the diary entry. Red circles are places she mentioned. Hover, and click on them for more information. Zoom out to see locations outside of Wuhan.
					</p>
					<p>
						The locations were automatically identified using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hanlp.hankcs.com/docs/index.html">HanLP</a>, and the coordinates were looked up manually. The maps were generated using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://plotly.com/">Plotly</a>. Some locations might not be on the map. For more information regarding the data, code, and how to contribute, see the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/wuhandiarymap/wuhandiarymap.github.io">GitHub repository</a>.
